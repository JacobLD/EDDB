# Welcome to the EDDB Database aggregation and visualization Project #

This is in fullfillment of a project for CS 523(Topics in Database Systems) at Western Illinois University

## Project Overview ##

### The Data ###
The data for this project is from an MMO called Elite Dangerous (ED). ED takes place in the vastness of space where players are free to do whatever they want within the confines of the game mechanics such as: trading, becoming a space pirate, astroid mining and much more. 

The game is proceduarally generated. When a player 'jumps' to a new system, one will be created using space math that is beyond me. This also means the game is somewhat infinite. 

The files used to construct the databases were pulled from [here](https://eddb.io/api). The data is updated daily when the official EDDB does its nightly data dump. If you want to recreate the results found in this project you can download the files we used [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBIUQmErZzgLlenMJXuB4oJvEPDopNGg/view?usp=sharing). To replicate simply extract the 'Data' folder into the root of the project and go from there.

## Project Goals ##
* Implement similar data across multiple database systems
    - [ ] MongoDB
    - [*] Neo4j
    - [ ] MariaDB
* Optimize similar queries for all of those databases
